							<div>Computer systems have evolved significantly in the few short decades that they have been available. Early computers relied on precise physical connections — specific parts of the device were wired to other parts, allowing them to function in tandem. Early designs gave way to more sophisticated ones, leading to computer systems that relied upon electronic memory. These systems were able to use binary machine language to perform complex computational tasks.

									Extensibility of application development tools</h5>
								<p class="info-box-text">Businesses expect their development tools to be able to allow them to create unique custom applications. Often, in order for this to be possible, the tools themselves need to be customized. So the application development tools, beyond offering their own frameworks, need to be able to easily leverage open source tools such as AngularJS, Backbone, and Ember to allow for code-level customization and configuration.

								<p class="info-box-text">Classically, enterprise tools have been tied to programming languages such as Java and .Net. Now there are newer breeds of application development frameworks and languages — such as the MEAN stack — that rely heavily on common languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and PHP. In order to provide developers with the resources they need to be able to design applications, application development tools themselves need to be compatible with these languages. This allows businesses to create applications for a wide variety of platforms and projects.</p>

								<p class="info-box-text">
									In 2015, mobile devices overtook desktop as the world’s most preferred method for accessing internet data. With this in mind, it is becoming imperative that application developers design their programs to function first and foremost on mobile devices. Mobile-first design shows that the developer is concerned with user convenience, and allows for a wider audience.

Low coding enables more rapid, collaborative development, and is something that 82% of IT teams are interested in pursuing.</p>

									As the amount of enterprise data continues to skyrocket, application developers are facing pressure to evolve. Over the years, the role of applications has transformed from a business tool to a core requirement for business. Mobile, web and Internet of Thing are all data-driven applications which are the conduit of most enterprise-customer interactions and have become a hub in helping enterprises differentiate via top-notch customer service.

									The world’s hunger for real-time information only grows stronger with each passing day, and this hunger is becoming increasingly met with the practice of retrieving data via an API. Organizations store vast amounts of data, much of it across multiple, disparate databases that are unable to talk to each other. So how can organizations counteract these challenges and find a way to connect disparate data, gaining buy-in from the team? The answer lies in APIs.</a>
